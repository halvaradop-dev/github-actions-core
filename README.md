## Work with events
In this section, you will learn about the triggers used to execute events with GitHub Actions. To run an event, you need to specify the trigger using the `on` keyword in the main line of your workflow file. In this section, you'll define the conditions under which you want the workflow to run. Some of the most commonly used triggers are:

- `workflow_dispatch`
- `push`
- `pull_request`
- `pull_request_review`

We will explore some of these triggers in the following sections, focusing on how to use them effectively and in which scenarios they can be advantageous.
